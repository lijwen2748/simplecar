1 To install simplecar: make under the root directory of source codes

2 To run simplecar: ./simplecar -h for details

For example, you can run "./simplecar -b -e ../benchmarks/single/counterp0.aig ./"
After the program teminates, two files "counterp0.log" (output of simplecar) and "counterp0.res" (counterexample in aiger model) will be generated under the current directory.

Updated 2022/10/8 by DongYibo:
We employ cmake to help build simpleCAR now.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```
